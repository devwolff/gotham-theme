* About

Welcome to the darkside..

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: about
   :END:
Gotham is a *very dark* Emacs color theme. It's a port of the [[https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham][Gotham theme for Vim]] and tries adhering closely to the original. There is support for both GUI and terminal Emacs. The terminal version assumes that your terminal emulator comes with a customized 16-color palette from the [[https://github.com/whatyouhide/gotham-contrib][Gotham contrib repository]], however you can enable 256 color support by customizing =gotham-tty-extended-palette= in exchange for a negligible amount of color degradation.
