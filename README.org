Gotham is a *very dark* Emacs color theme. It's a port of the
[[https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham][Gotham theme for Vim]] and tries adhering closely to the original. There is support for both GUI and terminal Emacs. The terminal version assumes that your terminal
emulator comes with a customized 16-color palette from the
[[https://github.com/whatyouhide/gotham-contrib][Gotham contrib repository]], however you can enable 256 color support by customizing
=gotham-tty-extended-palette= in exchange for a negligible amount of color degradation.

To install the theme via =package.el=, set up the
[[http://melpa.org/][MELPA (Stable)]] repository if you haven't already
and do =M-x package-install RET gotham-theme RET=.

Alternatively, you can install the theme manually by downloading
=gotham-theme.el= and putting it in a suitable location such as
=~/.emacs.d/themes/=. Add the following to your init file:

#+begin_example
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/themes/"))
#+end_example

Once the theme is installed, you can enable it with
=M-x load-theme RET gotham RET=. Make sure no other themes are enabled
with =M-x disable-theme=. To enable the theme automatically at startup,
add the following to your init file:

#+begin_example
(load-theme 'gotham t)
#+end_example
